## Bockbluster

This is a group project for CPSC 3660: Introduction to Database using HTML, CSS, jQuery, PHP, and MySQL by [Angela De Sousa Costa](https://github.com/angeladesousacosta), [Brayden Carlson](https://github.com/braycarlson), Rocky Au, and Juhyoung Park. The purpose of this project was to introduce the class to databases and making SQL queries. Bockbluster is a fully functional and feature-rich fictional video game rental service that includes features, such as: authentication, form validation, create, read, update and delete (CRUD) operations for several entities (i.e., video games, staff, customers, and stores), live searching, and more.

## Search

You can search for a video game by name, whether typing a new name or backspacing a previous name, and the view will update in real-time to display the matching games.

## Pagination

We use pagination to make the web page more managable in order for the employee to locate a video game. You can cycle forwards or backwards through the pages, and each page will load as you cycle.

## Renting

A demonstration of the "rental" page where the employee would ask for the customer's name, and input the video game(s) that the user wants to rent. This also features a live search for both the customer's name and the video game(s).

## Dashboard

The employee can access the dashboard for managing the customer's information, current and historic rental information and updating the customer's information, if needed.

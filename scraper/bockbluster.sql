Meat can be found in two varieties: big meat and small meat.  The effects of meat are additive but wear off over time.  A small meat gives Bonk the second stage of meat power but will eventually decay into the first stage of meat power,  and then back into regular Bonk.  Eating a small meat while in stage two will put Bonk into the third,  invincible stage of meat power.

The game replaced the standard downs system with an explosive ball that progresses from "cool" to "warm",  "hot",  and "critical" status as it is used. Players can only defuse the ball,  resetting it from its current state back to "cool" by crossing the 50 yard line or by change of possession,  whether through touchdown,  interception or fumble. A robot holding a critical ball while being tackled is destroyed along with the ball. The robots also possess finite durability. As offensive units are tackled,  they wear down,  finally issuing smoke and then flames after a number of hits. A flaming robot will explode when hit,  thereby fumbling the ball. Players can upgrade robots with faster and more durable units using money bonuses they earn during play. Players select from run,  pass or option plays on offense,  after which the computer presents four individual plays from which to choose. On defense,  a player can select short,  medium or long defenses,  and then select a specific defensive scheme. The standard Cyberball cabinet consists of two monitors,  each with two sets of controls for a maximum of four players,  but Atari Games released single player and two player versions as well. The standard configuration allows single player,  two player cooperative,  two player head-to-head or four player head-to-head play. Playing with two teams of two persons opened up a new dimension of gameplay. Computer controlled avatars ran offensive patterns in very specific ways before reaching their assigned passing spots. Human players,  however,  could exploit the fact that a number of offensive plays started with identical formations. By choosing one play,  but moving their avatars in imitation of a similar but different play,  the offensive team could disguise their intentions before suddenly breaking for their assigned pass locations. This offensive flexibility forced defending players to quickly recognize plays and move to break them up by rushing to what they guessed was the intended passing spot. Most often,  the timely use of the defender''s turbo,  a short-term speed boost usable once per play,  would determine whether the play resulted in a missed pass,  an interception,  a long gain,  or a score. This ability to improvise in four player mode built the popularity of Cyberball,  leading to many tournaments across the United States for a period of time. Cyberball was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992 by Jaleco. Tengen intended to release it unlicensed,  but Jaleco purchased rights to publish it first.

The objective is to solve several mysteries without accusing the wrong person or shooting too many unarmed villains. Each level starts out with a case to solve,  and some possible clues. The player drives Tracy''s vehicle through the city,  avoiding snipers and other cars,  to various locations mentioned in the clues,  where the action shifts to a side-scrolling adventure game. If the player goes to the right location,  he will find,  during the course of his side-scrolling fighting,  a clue icon that provides additional clues for the case,  or the player will be able to speak with a character from the comics who give clues.

INSERT INTO VIDEO_GAMES VALUES('Die Hard', '1991', 'There are 40 terrorists scattered throughout the building and John McClane''s task is to clear each floor of terrorists and he can then use the stairwell or the express elevator to travel upwards,  to a maximum of floors 31-35 (more floors are unlocked in "Advanced" mode). In addition,  by shooting at grids in the wall,  John is able to climb in the vents,  dropping into a designated spot or moving down or up a floor. At the start of the game,  the player character can only use a pistol (with 15 bullets) and his fists to dispose of enemies,  but later acquires several weapons,  such as submachine guns,  explosives and flashbangs which the terrorists can also use. When McClane is shot,  a few picked up items can drop where he must pick them up again. However,  bullets have minimal range,  only shooting straight or on a 45 degree angle. McClane''s health,  which is drained by bullet wounds,  can be restored by collecting soda cans from either enemies,  snack machines (by shooting several bullets at them) or empty rooms. The player loses the game when all life is lost. The player has about four minutes before one of the six locks are opened,  but can gain more time by destroying the main computer on the fifth level. Once all the locks have been opened,  the vault is opened and the game''s final battle is triggered. The player has only a few minutes to go to the 30th floor,  for a final confrontation with Karl,  Hans and any of the 40 terrorists left alive. One interesting aspect of the game allows the player to listen to Hans shouting orders to his guards through a two-way radio. However,  after the second lock is opened,  Hans will tell everyone to not use the radio. Also notable is the "foot meter". The meter starts out full,  but will eventually decrease if the player character steps on shattered glass or runs around. If the meter becomes empty,  McClane will walk much slower than he does when the foot meter is full. It can be restored by collecting med-kits. The game features cinematic sequences which change the story depending on which actions the player takes. For example,  if there is fewer than one minute left and the player defeats Karl,  the last scene with John and Holly will tell the player the roof has been destroyed by the helicopter sent by Hans.', 'Pack-In-Video Co.,  Ltd', 'Action', 'images/boxart/1695.png');

In fact,  the game begins with a digitized sample of that quote. The game play consists primarily of side-scrolling action. Dirty Harry can punch and kick the copious thugs that assault him using their own fists,  guns,  baseball bats,  nets,  and dynamite.

INSERT INTO VIDEO_GAMES VALUES('Double Dare', '1988', 'The video game version of Double Dare played exactly like its television counterpart. Rounds one and two were 10-question trivia rounds,  each of which started with a toss-up challenge. Round three – the obstacle course – featured eight stages to be completed within 60 seconds. Toss-up challenges determined which team got initial control of the trivia round. To complete a toss-up,  each player had to determine the precise speed and angle of whatever object they were throwing to hit a target.  Physical challenges were played the same way. All questions were multiple choice,  and each player could use the up or down arrows on the controller to make his selection. Three possible answers and either a dare,  double dare,  or physical challenge option were offered. The player confirmed his selection by pressing the A button. Confirming a dare doubled the base dollar value of the question; a double dare quadrupled the base dollar value. The player with the most money at the end of round two went on to the obstacle course. In order to move through an obstacle,  the player had to repeatedly alternate between pressing either the left and right or up and down arrows on the controller''s D-pad. In order to grab the flag,  the player had to position the on-screen contestant in just the right spot and then press the A button to jump and retrieve it. Some found it easier to get through the course by using the NES Advantage,  a joystick controller,  rather than the NES'' standard controller. The obstacles are all based on real obstacles from the show (with one exception) and are randomized before a game. They include The Tank,  The 1-Ton Human Hamster Wheel,  The Fireman''s Flagpole,  The Monkey Bars,  "Dallas",  Mount St. Double Dare,  Moonwalk,  and an original obstacle designed like a triangular jungle gym. "Prizes" for beating the obstacle course included a BMX bicycle,  television set,  an NES console,  and several other gifts,  ending with a exotic vacation -- though it can prove very difficult to get the best "ending" by completing the last obstacle. The obstacle course''s flag colour depended on which team was playing,  if blue,  the flags were blue,  and if red,  the flags were red.', 'Rare,  Ltd.', 'Puzzle', 'images/boxart/1698.png');

INSERT INTO VIDEO_GAMES VALUES('Dragon Warrior III', '1992', 'Dragon Warrior III is noted for greatly expanding upon the original Dragon Warrior and Dragon Warrior II. The game uses basic console role-playing game conventions,  such as leveling up by gaining experience points and equipping items. Battle is turn-based like the other games in the series. Dragon Warrior III features a class system,  in which each character has a certain class. While the Hero always keeps the Hero class,  the other characters can choose among the following: Soldier (Warrior in the GBC version),  Fighter,  Pilgrim (Cleric),  Wizard (Mage),  Merchant (Dealer),  Goof-Off (Jester),  Sage,  and Thief which was available only in the later versions. The choice of class greatly affects the character''s stats and spells he or she can learn. Furthermore,  upon reaching experience Level 20,  a character has the option of changing classes at the temple of Dhama,  found halfway through the game. The game starts with just the Hero in the party,  who then is able to recruit a party of three at the local tavern. Unlike most Dragon Quest parties,  aside from the Hero,  the party is not made up of characters involved in the story. Although only four characters can be in the party at a time,  extra members of the party can be kept at the tavern,  allowing room for new recruits. Another innovation is an arena where the player can place bets on the outcome of monster battles. The remakes incorporated some interface changes from later games in the series,  such as simplified door opening; the bag,  which replaced bank item storage; the item sorting "Tidy Item" and "Tidy Bag" commands; and the "Full HP" command,  which can be used outside of combat to automate the process of casting healing and status restoring spells. While the earlier Dragon Quest games were also non-linear,  Dragon Quest III was the most substantial example of open-world gameplay among the early Dragon Quest games. It also allowed the player to swap characters in and out of the party at will,  and another "major innovation was the introduction of day/night cycles; certain items,  characters,  and quests are only accessible at certain times of day."', 'Chunsoft', 'Adventure,  Role-Playing', 'images/boxart/1700.png');

Some elements of the game are indirectly taken from the classic arcade game Pole Position (except that the player does not have the option to play as a Formula One vehicle). In order to make it to the next level,  the player must make it from the starting line to the finish within the time limit with a young child on inline skates. Otherwise,  the player loses a chance and the player must start the stage over again. The host of the televised game show,  J. D.

Icy floors and slime colored ramps offer an additional challenge to the player. There are 72 rooms in the entire Fun House; with targets that are either numbered or given a generic target graphic. Each room has a name that usually gives a clue about how the room''s design is implemented.

The player controls a starfighter that can move left and right along the bottom of the playfield. Enemies swarm in groups in a formation near the top of the screen,  and then begin flying down toward the player,  firing bombs at the fighter. The game ends when the player''s last fighter is lost,  either by colliding with an enemy or one of its bullets,  or by being captured. Galaga introduces a number of new features over its predecessor,  Galaxian. Among these is the ability to fire more than one bullet at a time,  a count of the player''s "hit/miss ratio" at the end of the game,  and a bonus "Challenging Stage" that occurs every few levels,  in which a series of enemies fly onto and out of the screen in set patterns without firing at the player''s ship or trying to crash into it. These stages award a large point bonus if the player manages to destroy every enemy. Another gameplay feature new to Galaga is the ability for enemies to capture the player''s fighter. While the player is in control of just one fighter,  a "boss Galaga" (which takes two shots to kill) periodically attempts to capture the fighter using a tractor beam. If successful,  the fighter joins the enemy formation. If the player has more lives remaining,  play resumes with a new fighter. The captured fighter flies down with the enemy that captured it,  firing upon the player just like normal enemies,  and can be shot and destroyed. The player can free the fighter by destroying the boss Galaga while in flight,  causing the captured fighter to link up with the player''s current fighter,  doubling his or her firepower but also making a target twice as large. Galaga has an exploitable bug that can cause the attackers to stop firing bullets at the player,  due to a coding error. In addition,  similar to the famous "Split-Screen bug" in Pac-Man,  a bug exists in Galaga in which the game "rolls over" from Level 255 to Level 0. Depending on the difficulty setting of the machine,  this can cause the game to stall,  requiring that the machine be reset or power-cycled in order to start a new game.', 'Namco', 'Shooter', 'images/boxart/1834.png');

To help out,  you may discover one of three forces of fate under a tile which can be saved and used when you''re stuck. The forces are The Flash of Chance (allows symmetry to affect any matching tiles on the board,  even those surrounded by other tiles),  The Force of Balance (will eliminate brick walls that block the path of symmetry) and The Flag of Knowledge (this will make your next move for you in case you can''t spot what the best move is.)

Two players can compete head to head in the sprinting events and a total of eight can play in the same game. Three difficulty levels allow competitive events for both rookies to veterans in the genre. Sprinting events are a short and straight button mashing frenzy. 4 athletes compete simultaneously,  the first winner advancing to the next round (two qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast fingers and quick shotgun reaction can earn world record times. Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing bursts combined with timely pressed jumps. From the straight forward high and long jump events (run and then set the jump angle) to the more elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests,  three jumps must be carefully measured for world class results) and the complex pole vault,  where a strong run must be followed by a sharp pole fixation and good a release upwards. Both long jump and triple jump have a first round composed by three jumps,  the better eight progress into the second round,  where they are given three more jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the competition continues until all athletes miss three consecutive jumps. The throwing events (discus and javelin) work in the same fashion as the jumping events,  although trickier to pull,  as the setting of the angle must be followed by a timely release.

INSERT INTO VIDEO_GAMES VALUES('On the Ball', '1993', 'There''s a kind of knick-knack you may find in dusty games rooms,  a maze through which you navigate a marble by subtly tilting the board,  dancing with gravity and momentum,  deftly rolling your sphere out of dead ends and around the obstacles posed by holes in the board. Marble Madness explores this theme in a fudged 3-D perspective,  Cloud Kingdoms in a flat 2-D one -- both by directly influencing the actions of the ball.  The game takes a different approach toward a similar end; instead of moving the ball around the board,  you move the board around the ball. That''s right; from the get-go,  gravity pulls ever down,  down,  down on your ball toward the bottom of your screen regardless of board orientation; the task of the player is to rotate the board now clockwise,  now counter-clockwise,  to further a timely and unobstructed path beneath the ball in its progress toward each level''s goal before the timer ticks down to zero.  The game might as well have been named "inertia."  Many obstacles can be avoided,  but some must be engaged head-on: a certain momentum,  if not terminal velocity,  must be achieved to break through crumbling brick barriers; other obstacles toggle on and off like traffic lights,  demanding not only speed but timing.  Some influence the ball''s direction,  and in addition to merely delaying the ball''s progress,  touching some impediments incurs an additional time penalty -- conversely,  some blocks bestow time bonuses,  if you can afford the ever-diminishing time needed to take the scenic detour and collect them.

There are eight missions to complete in Operation Thunderbolt,  and each one has you shooting down soldiers,  choppers,  and tanks. The gameplay varies every one or two missions.

INSERT INTO VIDEO_GAMES VALUES('RPM Racing', '1991', 'RPM Racing was preceded by Rareware''s R.C. Pro-Am in 1988 and Electronic Art''s Racing Destruction Set in 1985,  with the latter being the larger influence. It is a precursor to Rock ''n Roll Racing,  which was done by the same developer. Combat,  obstacles and traction on the non-flat tracks play a significant role. There are 3 vehicle types to choose from that perform differently on pavement,  dirt,  ice,  flat or bumpy tracks. Cars can be armed with oil,  nitro and mines. Additionally,  there are 3 levels of tires,  engines,  shocks and armor. There are full race season,  single race and custom track modes. In 1 player games,  the 2nd player is replaced with one of 8 AI opponents who are each associated with their own vehicle. In season mode,  each track has an entrance fee and cash prize for placing 1st; often lesser cash prizes for lesser placements are also awarded. For an additional fee,  racers can opt to move to a higher racing class (levels) where fees and prizes are bigger. Each class has its own set of tracks that the player may choose from. No track is mandatory or unavailable within a class. The player also has the option of going back to a lower class for free,  which may become necessary if funds are eaten up be fees without winning prizes. However,  going up always incurs a fee,  even if the player has been there before. Custom track designing is not intuitive but fairly easy to learn. Players can set the track''s laps,  gravity and starting line type. Each track section can be pavement,  dirt,  or ice. Track sections are laid out like puzzle pieces on a 2D non-isometric grid (Pipe-Mania style). Sections include horizontal and vertical straights,  four standard 90° turns,  eight T-sections for diverging and converging multiple paths in any direction and a criss-cross. Either a horizontal or vertical special straight section is used as the starting grid. The starting grid can be oriented forward,  reversed,  face-off with player 1 forward,  or face-off with player 1 reversed. 7 points are used to adjust the 6 slopes in straight sections to 5 different heights. Slopes can be flat (0:1),  inclined (1:1),  or steep (2:1). Non-straight sections can only be adjusted for height for the entire section at once. An isometric view of individual sections is provided to help to orient the section''s design to the adjacent sections. If the edge of a section does not match the height of the adjacent section(s),  the player is warned immediately but may proceed without correcting the error immediately. But such error must be eliminated before the track can be saved. Also required for a track to be saved is no dead ends,  and a starting grid section. The track verification is surprisingly liberal,  even allowing diverging and converging paths that are against the flow of traffic (like turning around and going the wrong way up a freeway merging lane). The AI opponents are generally not able to discern the fastest or shortest route and can even be diverted into a path with no natural exit,  or with very clever path designs,  valid lap paths can be entirely different for player 1,  player 2 and AI players; which can lead to interesting traffic patterns.', 'Blizzard Entertainment', 'Racing', 'images/boxart/5818.png');

Young Joao is tasked with learning the skills of the sailor (he is the only character who starts at level one) and embarking on a quest of discovery; reaching the far east and eventually looking for the secret of Atlantis. Catalina Erantzo is a Spanish naval officer who believes her beloved and her brother were both murdered by the Portuguese armada. Vowing revenge she turns to a life of piracy and soon becomes a red haired scourge of the seas. Pietro Conti is a indebted man,  having inherited the financial woes of the Conti family. When the Duchess Franco hires him to spy on her son,  he accepts the job and obtains a ship. Pietro hopes to use these resources to seek out valuable treasure and clear up his family''s debt. Ernst Von Bohr is a geographer who is teaching classes in Holland. But he yearns to leave the classroom and sail the high seas,  living a life of adventure that he has only read about in books. When his friend,  Mercator offers to finance his initial voyage in exchange for cartography information about the world,  Ernst is given the opportunity to live out his dream. Ali Vezas is a poor orphaned child living in Istanbul and serving others. He dreams of becoming his own master and making his own fortune across foreign lands. A twist of fate aides in providing him with small loans,  with which he is able to afford his first ship and sail out with a cargo hold full of goods... Otto Baynes styles himself a Royal Knight of the British Empire,  in the service of his majesty the king. Promoted to Admiral of the British fleet,  the kingdom is worried about the increased naval power of Spanish fleets. Otto is given a letter of marque by the king and ordered to terrorize the Spanish Fleet. Equipping himself simply at first,  Otto strives to become a great Privateer in the name of King and Country.Regardless of the character chosen,  Uncharted Waters: New Horizons is a top-down sailing simulation. At sea,  players control the direction of their ship,  where speed is affected by the number/health of the crew,  the wind and the currents. Players can navigate anywhere there is water (though some ships are not ocean worthy) and discover interesting landmarks and new ports. Upon landing at a port,  the view is also top-down and the player can enter different buildings,  each with unique services and goods. These include: The Inn,  the Item Shop,  The Shipyard,  The Tavern,  The Castle,  The Guild Hall,  The Church,  The Merchant and the Harbor. It''s up to the player to earn enough gold to keep the crew fed and financed and keep the fleet repaired. Primary methods of earning money are through sea trade,  accepting jobs from the guild,  gambling and battle with other ships. During naval combat,  the game becomes a turn-based top-down strategy game,  with the player moving ships in order to obtain trajectories needed to fire cannons at enemy ships,  or run alongside enemy vessels in order to board them. If the player''s flagship attacks the flagship of the enemy fleet,  they can challenge the opponent to a duel. If accepted,  the game changes to a side-view of the two captains engaged in a fight. During this sequence,  the player can only choose which fighting maneuver (strike,  thrust,  parry,  lash) they wish to engage in.', 'Koei', 'Strategy', 'images/boxart/6321.png');

Changes made from the original Baseball Stars,  released by SNK in 1989: Female players are no longer included in any form.  Two additional batting stances. These additional stances are never used for players on custom teams. They will only appear on the pre-made teams'' players.  Enhanced pitch control.  Ability to shift field formations when playing defense.  Ability to view your team roster and ratings while in-game.  Sidearm-style pitchers are never generated on custom teams. They can only be hired.  Easier bunting controls; bunts are now retractable. (Hold Down+A to bunt instead of stopping the swing partway through.)  Ability to see lead-offs while pitching/batting.  Six pitchers and four bench players instead of five each.  New music and home run animations. These include the "Power connect" graphic for a two-run home run,  an animated graphic of the batter rounding the bases and pumping his fist for a 3-run home run or grand slam,  and a similar (yet very rare) graphic including a Yorkshire terrier following the batter for a come-from-behind (usually game-ending) home run in a dramatic situation.  Can no longer name custom teams or rename players on custom teams.  You can still upgrade player using the same 15-point system introduced in the original Baseball Stars. However,  the random points you get to disperse to various skills each time you purchase a player upgrade changed from between 1 and 6 to between 1 and 5.  Player upgrades overall are much more expensive while the money received during play has remained about the same. This makes it much more time-consuming to upgrade players to maximum.  You can still fire players and hire players. However,  due to the fact you cannot change the names of hired players your hired player will always be named generic names given by the game (examples ''STAR 5'',  ''ROOK 2'',  etc.).

Before each event,  players have the opportunity to go shopping in the mall to buy power-ups for their characters. These items are paid for through the various medals that each team achieve as they progress through the challenge,  but since the winner of the challenge is the team that collects the most medals overall,  players must be fairly judicious in how much they spend. There are two types of events in the game: individual events (Hammer Throw and Roof Top Jumping) and head-to-head events (400 Meter Hurdles,  Swimming and Fighting). In individual events,  each team takes turn individually and ranking is determined by who gets the most points.

The game was originally targeted to pre-teen and younger teenage girls,  but became unexpectedly popular with older teenagers and women in their 20s. Angelique is credited with "set[ing] up the speci?cs and conventions of women’s games: a focus on romance,  easy controls and utilizing other multimedia." In 2002,  Konami released its very successful Tokimeki Memorial Girl''s Side,  which brought many new fans to the still-new genre. In 2006,  Famitsu''s listings for the Top 20 selling love games included seven otome games. Early games borrowed heavily from the iconography and story conventions of "retro shoujo manga",  "the archetypical girly heroines,  the emphasis on pure,  sexless,  tranquil romance and on a peaceful,  stable setting",  but as the category expanded,  other narrative and gameplay elements were introduced,  including action/adventure,  combat and plots in which "the heroine can ‘save the world’ and ‘get the guy’ at the same time". Commercially available English-developed otome games in modern times include Date Warp,  Fatal Hearts,  and Heileen. The latter two also include options for lesbian romance. McKenzie & Co (1995) from American Laser Games and Girl''s Club (1992) from Philips Interactive were simulation games for girls developed and released in the US in the past.

INSERT INTO VIDEO_GAMES VALUES('Bahamut Lagoon', '1996', 'Bahamut Lagoon combines RPG mechanics with squad-based combat. Characters have HP,  MP (SP for fighter characters),  EXP,  equipment,  stats and class-specific,  SP-draining special elemental abilities very much like traditional console RPGs. The player can explore his surroundings,  talk to people and visit shops when not in battle,  though to a limited degree as there is no world map and no way to leave the current area. The game''s core is its turn-based battles fought on a 2d grid. Characters are assembled into parties of four and the player allowed a maximum of six parties,  which are usually well outnumbered. The two opposing sides act in alternating turns so that each party can move once and/or attack once a turn. Attacks are divided into distant and close-up combat. In the former,  a party uses a special ability (e.g. casting fireballs,  throwing lightning,  healing allies) of one of its members at a distance. The range and possible area of effect damage vary per ability. If the attacking party has two or more characters with the same ability,  they join in the action to multiply its effectiveness. Distant combat results in less money and generally less damage,  but the target cannot retaliate. Distant attacks can also affect the field; fire and ice ignite or extinguish forests and melt or freeze ice,  etc. Close-up,  each unit in two adjacent opposing parties can act once. Very much like Final Fantasy SNES combat,  they can attack an enemy,  use an item or a special ability (though these can''t be combined and most only affect one target instead of all) or defend. Dragons are the player''s ace in the hole. They have their own stats and gain experience like normal characters do. In battle,  each party has a dragon attached to it and draws a large portion of its strength from that of its dragon: if a party''s dragon is slain,  the party will lose the ability to use special attacks and class-specific abilities for the remainder of the map. The beast acts as a very powerful autonomous unit that moves after its party does and it cannot be controlled beyond very simple commands,  e.g. "Come!" Out of battle,  dragons will eat anything and raising them by feeding them items is an important part of the game. Feeding can improve their stats as well as affect their behavior on the field,  and the dragons develop into new forms as they grow. The player can change the characters in each of the parties,  their formation as well as what dragon represents them at will.', 'Squaresoft', 'Role-Playing,  Strategy', 'images/boxart/9054.png');

Before they left,  the humans created a Bio-Computer assigned to replenish Earth''s ecosystem in hopes of returning to Earth. 50 years after terra-forming parts of Mars,  the human colonists were attacked by mysterious,  but hostile UFOs. The military leaders among the colonists set up an attack force to defend the colonists using state of the art fighter ships identified as the Icarus. The main operation of attack is called "Acrobat Mission" because it exceeds the technical flying ability of the pilots. In the arcade version,  surviving fighter pilots Jet and Nova are available for the player to choose for the rest of the game,  but both were discluded from the Super Famicom port,  making the player''s pilot anonymous as well as discarding Nova''s custom color scheme.

ONE DAY HALF A CENTURY AFTER HUMANS ARRIVED,  MARS WAS ATTACKED BY STRANGE FLYING OBJECTES. TO FIGHT THESE ENEMIES,  THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF THE DEFENCE AGENCY ORGANIZED THE TASK FORCE ARMY AND STARTED THE DOG FIGHT WITH INVADERS QUICLY. THE OPERATION WAS CALLED "ACROBAT MISSION" AS IT EXCEEDED THE PILOT''S TECHNICAL LIMIT." Players started the game equipped with the default weapon,  the Standard Shot: a semi-automatic laser weapon. Though moderately powerful,  the Standard Shot cannot be upgraded or charged. Once the player has lost a significant number of lives and their selected weapon his lost its upgrades,  the Standard Shot will once again take over. Two other weapons are selectable to the player,  one of which is the Wave Shot (announced as Wide in the Arcade version). The Wave Shot is a spread shot that increases in size,  numbers and strength. When charged,  the Wave Shot can unleash a short range,  but powerful laser blast that increases in width and strength when Wave icons are collected. The other weapon was the Hurricane Shot,  a unique area-effect weapon that encircles the ship clockwise when fired before flying forward. When charged,  the Hurricane Shot fires a ball of energy across the screen,  but there is a one second delay every time the shot is fired. The player also had Bombs although unlike many shooters,  the player can only hold up to two bombs. Once collected however,  the two bombs get physically mounted under the ship''s wings. If an enemy shot hits one of the bombs,  then the bomb will detonate,  creating a destructive shield for the player. The player can manually detonate either bomb at will. The player''s Icarus fighter ship has a number of defenses at its disposal as well. Whenever the player moves their ship in any given direction,  a burst of flame from the ship''s jet exhaust will shoot out from the opposite direction the player moves the ship in. This applies to all directions: left,  right,  front,  back and all four diagonal angles. This jet exhaust not only serves an aesthetic purpose,  but it can also harm nearby enemies and destroy nearby objects. Whenever the player is hit,  their ship will steer wildly out of control. Once this happens,  a timer will appear near the ship which indicates how long the ship has until it explodes. The explosion of the player''s ship will harm any nearby enemies. Also,  because the Icarus is apparently well built,  any kamikaze enemies or drifting objects that touch it will not damage or destroy the player''s ship,  allowing the player less restrictive movement.', 'Micronics', 'Shooter', 'images/boxart/18940.png');

Characters also have a team up special if playing in two player mode.

Use the special color combo attacks to make Popoons and Poroporos pour into your opponent''s area! Be the first to get rid of all your Poroporos to win! Similar to other falling block tile-matching video games,  the core gameplay element consists of player-controlled blocks falling from the top of the playing field. In Hebereke''s Popoitto,  pairs of blocks,  where each block in the pair can be any available color,  appear from the top of the playing field and continue to fall until they fall on top of the ground or another block. The pair of blocks are,  as long as they''re still falling,  controlled by the player and can be rotated.When a pair of blocks is suspended,  a new pair of player-controlled blocks will fall from playing field ceiling. By lining up four or more blocks with the same color in certain formations the whole formation disappears. The available formations can be straight horizontal or vertical lines or simply just any adjoining formation,  depending on the set difficulty level. What sets Hebereke''s Popoitto apart from other similar games is that moving creatures,  named Poro-porous,  will float suspended in mid-air on the playing field. Sporadically,  Poro-porous will move one space right,  left,  up or down. Touching a Poro-poro with a pair of blocks will as always suspend the blocks,  and consequently the erratic behaviour of Poro-porous makes it more difficult for the player to plan ahead. Each Poro-poro has its own color and can be,  just as with any other block,  destroyed by making a formation with the same color. A game is won when every Poro-poro on the playing field is eliminated. A game can also be lost when the blocks fill up to the top of the playing field. The difficulty level controls,  as stated earlier,  the possible formations to build. An easier difficulty level will accept any adjoining formation of same-colored blocks,  while a harder difficulty level will only accept straight horizontal or vertical lines.

Each side is represented by a craft called a "rotofoil",  which can be controlled by either a human player or a computer-controlled "droid" with ten levels of difficulty. (The game allows for human vs. human,  human vs. droid,  and droid vs. droid matches.) The basic objective of the game is to score points by either firing or carrying a floating ball into the opponent''s goal. The game takes place on a flat,  checkerboard playfield,  and each player''s half of the screen is presented in a first-person perspective. A player can gain possession of the ball by simply running into it,  at which point it is held in a force field in front of the craft. The opponent can attempt to knock the ball away from the player using the fire button,  and the player in possession of the ball can also fire the ball toward the goal. When a player does not have possession of the ball,  his or her rotofoil automatically turns at 90-degree intervals to face the ball,  while possessing the ball turns the player toward the opponent''s goal. The goalposts move from side to side at each end of the playfield,  and as goals are scored,  the goal becomes narrower. Pushing the ball through the goal scores one point,  firing the ball through the posts from close range scores two points,  and successfully scoring from long range (where the goalposts are not visible) scores three points. The maximum number of total points between the two players is ten,  meaning that any points scored that would take the combined total above ten will cause the opponent''s score to be reduced by the same amount,  resulting in a kind of tug of war scoring system. The game ends when either a player successfully scores ten points or the timer runs out.

The main character,  Kitarou,  is the last living member of a Ghost tribe. He is missing his left eye,  but his hair usually covers the empty socket. He fights for peace between humans and yōkai,  which generally involves protecting the former from the wiles of the latter.

Fights are turn-based,  where the player must input his command,  and then watch the sequence of event play out until the round is over and the next round begins. However,  even though it is simplified,  it is actually a rather difficult and challenging game.

A majority of the enemies only provide experience points in the single digits until much later in the game,  although to compensate,  the amount of experience needed to reach each level is low by comparison as well. Kitarou maxes out at Level 10 when he reaches 999 experience points. The map of the game''s overworld is a fairly faithful representation of Japan,  along with part of Korea and a small unidentified island. Kitarou must explore the island nation to rescue his girlfriend and the rest of the world from the onslaught of evil Youkai that threaten to take over the world of the living.

Her dream becomes reality when goblins kidnap the boy—but Sarah unexpectedly finds herself horrified by the loss. So she sets forth to retrieve him,  and finds herself on the adventure of a lifetime. To accomplish her task,  she will somehow have to reach the center of the fantastical labyrinth where the wicked Goblin King has imprisoned the lad.

This title differentiated itself from other baseball games by obtaining permission from the Professional Baseball Organization of Japan to use the official names of the 12 Japanese baseball teams and their players.

Outfielder and first baseman Warren Cromartie,  formerly with the Montreal Expos,  and playing for the Yomiuri Giants at the time,  was chosen to help promote the game. To further distinguish the game,  the developers chose to use a more realistic approach when depicting the players on the field,  as opposed to the more cartoonish look utilized by Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium and many other baseball games. Additionally,  the view remains fairly close to the ball after the batter hits the ball,  as opposed to zooming out to a bird''s eye view of the field.

Its spiritual descendant is Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas due to its simulation of gang warfare. Once the main gang leader is defeated in either Tsuppari Wars (ツッパリウォーズ?) or Tsuppari Suku (ツッパリスク?) mode,  the remaining members of the gang switch membership to become a gray-colored gang that does not have a leader. Consequently,  all territory that belonged to leader that was killed in combat becomes neutral territory with a number describing the strength of the "neutral gangs." These "neutral gangs" will attempt to defend their turf. In order for a gang with colors (red,  blue,  or green) to use the land as their own,  they must eliminate all the gangsters in that territory. However,  invasions can be canceled before they can begin by saying "no" when asked to fight (たたかい?,  "Struggle"). Neutral gangs,  fortunately,  do not have ability to invade the territories of the red,  blue,  or green colored gangs. There are three difficulty levels for computer opponents and games are possible with two or three colors (but never with only one color). After naming the character (using the Japanese alphabet),  the player must select his face that will represent his main gang leader.

The brawl can be re-initiated either during the player''s next turn or during the opponent''s turn.

Supapoon is a Super Famicom game released late in 1995 that presents a colorful world with an elastic blue hero reminiscent of a Dragon Quest slime. The hero''s solar system has been invaded by a group of yellow balls wearing triangular shades,  and he jumps into action to send them packing. Supapoon is inspired by games like Breakout and Arkanoid,  but offers a few twists of its own,  like being able to project the ball with additional power by using the "paddle"''s intrinsic elasticity,  and a constant timer that ticks down faster whenever the paddle takes damage from skull drops or enemy attacks. The goal of the game is to reflect a ball of energy around a table,  ensuring that it doesn''t fall off the bottom of the screen. Rather than clearing all the blocks on the screen,  which is common for other games of this type,  the player only has to remove the yellow balls wearing shades to clear a level. They will receive a bonus for clearing the screen,  however. Occasionally,  items will drop from the destroyed blocks. These include extending and shrinking the paddle,  adding more balls,  extra lives and power stars. By collecting power stars,  the player can increase the strength that the ball leaves the paddle,  causing more damage to blocks. If the player finds four stars,  this charged up bounce will clear the screen. Skulls can often drop from blocks too,  and collecting these will lower a green gauge at the side of the screen,  which operates as a combined timer/health bar.', 'Now Production Co.', 'Action', 'images/boxart/33283.png');

Kirby''s Star Stacker is similar in many respects to other puzzle games that were around at the time of its release,  most notably,  Dr. Mario and Tetris. The goal of the game is to earn as many stars possible by matching pairs blocks,  (also referred to as friends in-game) that fall from the top of the play area. There are three types of blocks,  all based on Kirby''s friends from Kirby''s Dream Land 2: Rick the hamster,  Coo the owl,  and Kine the fish. Stars are scored by sandwiching the stars between two matching blocks. When stars are scored,  they disappear from the play area along with the pair of blocks enclosing them. The game is lost when the falling blocks reach the top of the play area,  so it is critical to eliminate as many blocks as possible by scoring stars. One of the primary enhancements of the SNES remake is story mode,  in which Kirby faces several opponents from other Kirby games (mostly from Kirby Super Star). The game''s title is exactly the same as the Japanese title of the Game Boy version of Kirby''s Star Stacker. There were plans to release the game overseas,  but they were halted after Nintendo of America stopped shipping SNES games in 1997,  leaving the game Japan-exclusive.', 'HAL Laboratory', 'Puzzle', 'images/boxart/38662.png');

The completed product was inexplicably canceled by Nintendo,  and the game''s key elements were later developed into Maxis''s 1996 PC game release titled SimTunes. Sound Fantasy contains eccentric concepts and untested game mechanics. Music games,  especially on home consoles,  were not popular in the early 1990s,  and it wouldn''t be until much later in the decade that they gained mainstream attention.[citation needed] The Sound Fantasy prototype contains four different games in one cartridge. Pix Quartet was inspired by Toshio Iwai''s Music Insects. There are four insects of different colors,  where the player can select different insect to each represent a different instrument. They crawl all over the screen,  where the player can draw. Insects that crawl over a colored pixel make a note. Each color represents a different note for each insects. Sample Demos can be loaded to demonstrate the capabilities of this game. Beat Hopper contains three different modes: A-type,  B-type and Training. A-type is a rhythm game in the style of Q-bert,  where an insect on a pogo must make every block disappear after stepping on it as many times needed. Each block makes its own sound and the order does not matter. The player can improvise a song with each block. B-type requires the player to follow a path of blocks that appears every time the player touches one. The player must make as many steps as possible without losing three lives. Ice Sweeper indicates two modes: A-type and B-type. This game is a Breakout clone with a few new twists added after a few stages,  such as four bats controlled by a single player. Star Fly is inspired by music boxes,  where the player can set a sequence of stars in the sky,  to compose a song. A higher star corresponds to a higher musical note.

Jongbou is a combination of the popular Chinese board game Mahjong and a block-breaking game such as Breakout. Players bounce a ball around a Mahjong table filled with concealed tiles,  with their goal being to dislodge the tiles and collect the ones they wish to add to their hand by passing underneath them as they fall. The stage is over either after all the tiles have fallen or the player has a winning hand. The block-breaking aspect is simple: Simply direct the bouncing ball by hitting it with the paddle to first destroy the wall of betting tokens before reaching the hidden tiles. Hitting a tile once reveals it,  allowing the player to strategically direct the ball so that they can collect the tile (if desired) and still catch the ball before it leaves the screen. In addition,  there are various power-ups that are mingled with the tiles. These have different characters than the dragons/seasons/flowers and provide different benefits,  such as a partial wall to block the ball,  forcefields that slow it down and special tiles that reveal all the remaining hidden tiles. It should be noted that as useful as a tile might be towards obtaining a winning hand,  it is not worth losing the ball (and subsequently a life) over. Mahjong can seem a little convoluted,  but it plays essentially like the card game rummy: The goal is to collect and discard tiles until the player has a hand that is comprised of Chows (straights of three,  worth nothing but easier to obtain),  Pungs (three-of-a-kind) and Kongs (four-of-a-kind,  worth more than Pungs). The player normally has thirteen tiles in a hand,  though this becomes fourteen tiles when they''re in the process of discarding one. If those fourteen tiles comprise of Chows,  Pungs and Kongs (and one pair) then it is a winning hand and the holder can declare Mahjong to win the round. For the purposes of this game,  much of the game''s rules are unnecessary,  including betting or indeed any of the multiplayer aspects. The goal is to simply put together a winning hand by collecting the right tiles as they drop. Tiles can range from "Characters" (a black symbol over a red symbol,  actually Chinese numerical symbols for thousands),  "Bamboo" (green sticks) and "Wheels" (black and red circles),  as well as the three dragons (the red and green characters and the blank white tiles),  the four seasons and four flowers.

It was originally developed for Arcades and ported to MSX and the Famicom. Lot Lot is a puzzle game involving pachinko balls and has a superficiality similarity to that popular Japanese gambling game. Instead of firing the balls around a table full of pins that change their course,  the goal is to make sure the balls run into one of the four troughs that score points,  with the higher numbered scoring zones being preferable. If any drop into the "Out" zone,  the game is over. Tokuma Shoten Publishing is a major conglomerate in Japan that mostly publishes magazines,  though in the 80s they tried branching out into other mediums as well. Lot Lot is one of their earliest forays into publishing video games,  and is the first game of theirs to be published for the NES/Famicom. The player changes the destination of these balls with a pair of arrows: A pink arrow and a green arrow. Pressing the action button will switch the contents of the two boxes the two arrows are hovering over. The pink arrow goes where the player directs and the green allow follows the same path with a slight time delay. The idea is to pass over the first box that the player wants to teleport balls from and move over to a second box they wish to teleport to,  and waiting until the green arrow passes over the original box before pressing the button. The walls of the maze will randomly open and close for limited durations,  so the player must send the right balls to the right box quickly in order for them to drain into the scoring zones (or lure them away from draining into the Out zone).

Also,  it automatically calculates and displays the score on the screen. Mahjong is a game based on the popular Chinese table game of the same name. It was released by Nintendo for the Famicom and Famicom Disk System,  and was one of the earliest titles for both systems. Mahjong (stylized on cart as "MAH-JONG") is a video game simulation of the board game of the same name,  a tile-based multiplayer game that is similar to the card game Rummy. Nintendo themselves developed and published the game and it was one of the very first original games created for the Famicom/NES system,  along with Gomoku Narabe Renju (another board game adaptation). The game was later adapted for the Famicom Disk System. It was never released outside of Japan. Mahjong follows the popular Japanese "Riichi" rule set and is adapted for play against a single CPU opponent. Three different modes are available (in order from top to bottom): Beginner - No timer or penalties Intermediate - No timer; a 12, 000 point chombo penalty is imposed for calling an invalid win Advanced - A 10-second limit is imposed,  chombo applies; CPU is more aggressive A full game consists of three matches,  each consisting of East and South rounds,  each round further consisting of East and South winds (West and North are not played,  so rounds progress after only two dealer changes). The player with the highest point total at the end of each match is declared the winner of that match,  and the best of three matches is declared winner at the end of the game. Left/Right and A are used to draw,  select,  and discard tiles. Up/Down and B are used to select and make calls. Other gameplay notes and special rules: It is not possible to go bust; rounds continue even if a player''s score drops into the negatives,  and Riichi can still be called with less than 1, 000 points. The Dora and Ura-Dora indicators are the Dora tiles themselves,  not the next in sequence. Red Dora tiles are not used. In all modes,  there is a 3-second window after the final discard to declare a win; even if the final discard is a winning tile,  the game will automatically end the round if the player does not call in time. Tenpai payments are 1, 500 instead of 3, 000. Ryanshi (two yaku minimum) is enforced after 5 honba. The honba counter counts up to 9,  but rounds can continue beyond that with the counter looping around to 0.

While ostensibly a racing game,  the style of gameplay tends to change per level. Paris-Dakar Rally Special! is an unusual racing game in which the player must successfully win the Paris-Dakar Rally. However,  in order to do so,  the player is faced with a wide variety of odd challenges to overcome,  a scant number of which actually involve racing. Developed by ISCO for the NES,  Paris-Dakar Rally is notorious for its bizarre structure. Depending on who is asked it is either a testament to the NES library''s occasionally creative and off-beat ingenuity,  or a legendary "kusoge" (crap game). Stage 1 - Preparation In the first stage the player is without vehicle. In order to race in the Paris-Dakar Rally,  the player must first acquire a sponsor,  some money,  a car and a navigation partner. In order to achieve these objectives,  the player must walk around town and talk to the right order of sponsors,  executives,  bank tellers and rally co-ordinators to begin. Once the car has been purchased and a navigation partner chosen (which is resolved with a fast reactions mini-game),  the player can take a plane to Paris to begin the rally. Stage 2 - First Day The first day races most closely resemble an actual racing game. The player has a top-down view of a vertically-scrolling track and must control the car''s speed and direction with the D-pad. In order to qualify for the next stage of the event,  the player must make it through the course within a time limit while dodging hostile vehicles from behind and in front. Losing three lives restarts the stage. Stage 3 - Second Day This mode more closely resembles the Arcade game Rally-X. The player must maneuver and corner around the Parisian streets in order to avoid rival drivers. They can distract pursuing CPU opponents by dropping rubber balls (possibly tires) behind the player''s car to deter them. Stage 4 - Third Day The action changes to a side-scrolling perspective and now the player must contend with birds dropping deadly eggs,  bridges that collapse once driven on,  rolling boulders,  fires and other obstacles on the racecourse. Occasionally,  the player will need to leave the vehicle in order to hit a switch to extend a bridge before they can continue. Stage 5 - Fourth Day As the player is on a variant of the Paris-Dakar course that will inconveniently cross a major sea,  the player must steer their car-boat over and under the ocean and avoid various hostile sea creatures and jagged rocks. Stage 6 - Fifth Day Into the Dakar desert,  the player must drive vertically up the screen while avoiding vicious desert animals like snakes,  scorpions,  spiders,  camels and other hostile racers. The player must also contend with some narrow walls and a section where they must cross between two rafts. Stage 7 - Sixth Day At some point between starting the race and the sixth day,  World War 3 broke out and the player must use their newly mounted machine guns to take down the enemy aircraft and tanks between them and the finishing line. Stage 8 - Final Day The Dakar finish line is just ahead,  all the player must do is survive a gauntlet similar to that of the First Day. As with that stage,  the player must be alert for other racers all around them and make it to the end within the time limit.', 'ISCO', 'Action', 'images/boxart/40637.png');

Fuji Television created a 43 episode anime series based on the novel in 1988,  and this video game adaptation is based on that TV show.

However,  rather than selecting destinations from a menu,  the player manually walks around the different locales using a top-down perspective. There are also action sequences where the player must avoid random pedestrians when leaving the estate.

In these stages,  the player may restart the game with all items intact in the last area reached. Afterwards,  if the player dies,  they must return to the Chamber of Kali (Wave 9) and finish the game from that point. Each level also has a timer that goes from 99 to zero.

It was the first Metroid game to be released in the series. The game has a re-release in 2004 for Game Boy Advance then 3 years later in 2007 for the Virtual Console on the Wii. The gameplay of Metroid,  which focuses on exploring and searching for upgrades to help collect items in previous areas,  was a major influence for other games. It was also made popular for speedrunning to get fast time completions for the various endings. Metroid was praised for being one of the earliest games to have the protagonist as a woman. The player will need to beat the game in less than five hours to reveal this. The English manual even refers to the main character as "he". Game Informer ranked this game 7 out of 100 in their top 100 list. Metroid is first chronologically in the Metroid universe. The Space Pirates end up attacking a space research vessel owned by the Galactic Federation to steal Metroid craeture samples. A Metroid is a floating organism that is dangerous and latches onto another organism to drain their energy,  killing the other organism. The plan that Space Pirates intend to do is replicate the Metroids by using beta rays on them. This will turn them into biological weapons that Space Pirates will use to kill any living beings opposing them. The Galactic Federation located the Space Pirate Base on planet Zebes while they were looking for the Metroids that were stolen. The Federation tried to attack the planet but were resisted by th Pirates,  forcing a retreat. The Federation decided to go with their last resort,  which was to send a single bounty hunter to infiltrate the Pirate base to annihilate the Mother Brain. Mother Brain is a biomechanical creature controlling the Pirate Base and their defenses. The Federation chose to send Samus Aran,  who is considered the best bounty hunter in existence. After landing on planet Zebes,  Samus starts exploring the planet by traversing the caverns on Zebes. While on the mission,  she runs into Kraid,  who is a Space Pirate ally. She then later finds Ridley,  who is the commander of the Space Pirates. She defeats both of them. Samus finally finds the Mother Brain and destroys it. Upon destroying the Mother Brain,  Samus sete a bomb with a timer set at 99.9 seconds. She then escapes the planet,  leaving the lair in pieces. The player takes control of Samus Aran for the mission on Zebes. The planet is open world with the areas connected with elevators and doors. Samus begins with a power beam that is weak and her only firearm. She also has the ability to jump. While exploring the caverns,  the player will find and collect upgrades that will give Samus enhanced abilities and better her weaponry and armor. These upgrades will allow Samus to access previous areas that were not accessible. Some of the upgrades the player can get for Samus include Morph Ball,  allowing Samus to change to a ball and roll into small tunnels,  the Bomb,  which is used while in the ball form and sets a small explosive that can open a hidden floor or wall path,  and the Screw Attack,  which is a somersault attack that can destroy almost any enemy in their path. On top of the common enemies,  the player will encounter the two bosses Kraid and then Ridley. Both of them will need to be defeated,  with Kraid coming first and Ridley second in the gameplay. When regular enemies are destroyed,  they will leave ammo for missiles or energy pellets to refill Samus’s life. The player can upgrade Samus’s maximum health and carrying capacity by finding energy tanks marked with an E and missile tanks. Defeating bosses will also help with upgrades. When the player defeats both Kraid and Ridley,  the pathway near the start of the game will open,  giving access to the last area.

The prosperous planet Altile (aka ''Altair'') has remained at peace for centuries,  but in 2036 AD,  a mysterious and extra-dimensional entity invaded the peaceful world and turned it into a barren wasteland. The player takes control of Naito (aka ''Night'',  ''Z-type Earth Defence'' or ''ZED''),  an android sent to stop the invasion and keep aliens from taking over the planet. Naito must explore eight large areas on Altile,  all subdivided into several zones called ''Periods''. Each period only requires the player to find a key and an exit door in order to successfully complete it. However,  they are conveniently hidden from view and this is where the weapon system comes into play. The robot is equipped with bombs and a blaster gun - although the latter is rather limited and mainly used to take down enemies,  the powerful bombs explode after a short period of time and are designed to clear parts of the playfield (such as bushes or pillars),  thus revealing hidden items (such as the key). But,  of course,  there is a catch and Night instantly receives extensive damage if he gets caught within a bomb''s blast radius. Bombs also come in limited quantities and the player needs to constantly refill his bomb bag by either killing enemies or by revealing special icons hidden within the playfield. Additionally,  the android comes with a limited amount of batteries - each battery provides a small amount of energy which gradually,  and inexorably,  depletes. Thankfully,  Naito can use or store a myriad of items - Standard items (such as Bombs,  Extra Energy,  Score Items or Keys) are instantly activated,  whereas Select Items (such as Energy Tanks,  Missiles,  Super Speed,  Candles/Lamps,  Super Bombs) must be manually activated in the inventory screen (available by pressing select). Although the goal of each Period is to locate a key and the exit door,  some levels feature different challenges,  item shops,  treasure rooms and a multitude of other secrets.

Even after two successful efforts by the Hunters Mega Man X and Zero to stop a Maverick leader named Sigma from attempting to exterminate the human race,  Maverick activity seems to continue.

Normally,  you can select only the first 10 levels,  but by pressing A,  B,  Up,  then Down on Controller 1,  then pressing A to increase the level number counter,  you can select levels 11-20 as well. The levels increase in speed as they progress and on most of the levels there are blocks which are in full 3D as opposed to standard Tetris blocks. On each level,  4 layers have to be cleared to advance. Clearing all of the blocks on the screen automatically ends the level.

Recognizing the potential danger of this model (in particular if he were to break the first rule of robotics: a robot must never harm a human being),  Light sealed X away in a diagnostic capsule for over 30 years of testing. X''s capsule was uncovered by an archaeologist named Dr. Cain almost 100 years after X''s creation. Excited by the possibilities X presented,  Cain disregarded the warnings Light had logged in the capsule and created a legion of robots that replicated X''s free will; these robots were called "Reploids" (shortened from Replica Android,  but known as "Repliroids" in Japan). A number of Reploids turned against humans. These Reploids were dubbed "Mavericks" ("Irregulars" in Japan),  and a force called the Maverick Hunters ("Irregular Hunters") was formed to combat them. The Maverick Hunters were led by Sigma until he,  too,  became a Maverick and declared war against the humans,  thus starting the Maverick War. X took it upon himself to join the Maverick Hunters under their new leader Zero. Throughout the series,  X,  Zero,  and later Axl (a prototype of the next-generation Reploid) battle against the Mavericks to stop their plots to destroy the human race. After the series reached an unresolved cliffhanger,  a game entitled "Mega Man X Dive" was released by Capcom Taiwan in which a human plays Mega Man X,  until due in part to some corrupted data known as Maverick Data,  he/she gets transported into the Deep Log,  a massive database with data on every Mega Man game.

Thanks to the efforts of Mega Man and his friends,  Dr. Wily was finally brought to justice. However,  Wily had always known that he might be imprisoned one day,  and so he had constructed four advanced models of Robot Masters as backups in a hidden laboratory: Burst Man,  Cloud Man,  Junk Man,  and Freeze Man. If they did not receive any communication for six months,  they would activate and begin searching for their master. 6 months later,  the robots activate,  round up an army,  and go on a rampage throughout the city in which Dr. Wily is being held. Mega Man is called into action. Upon driving into the city with Roll and Auto,  he sees that it is in ruins,  and that he is too late to stop Wily''s Robot Masters from liberating the evil scientist. Mega Man gives chase,  but is stopped by Bass,  a robot with capabilities much like Mega Man''s own,  and his robotic wolf Treble. After a brief skirmish,  Mega Man is informed that the two of them are battling Wily as well.[4] Bass and Treble then take off,  leaving Mega Man confused,  but convinced that he has new allies and determined to again stop Dr. Wily''s plans. After Wily''s Robot Masters are defeated,  he dispatches four more to combat the protagonist: Spring Man,  Slash Man,  Shade Man,  and Turbo Man. In one of the locations,  Mega Man encounters an injured Bass and sends him to Dr. Light''s lab for repairs. Mega Man defeats the remaining Robot Masters and goes back home,  learning upon arriving that Bass had gone berserk and had torn up the lab,  escaping with parts for new enhancements Dr. Light was working on. Wily appears on the video monitor and reveals that Bass and Treble are actually his own creations,  and that they only gained his trust in order to steal the parts.[5] Bass'' apparent ambition is to best Mega Man in combat and prove himself as the strongest robot in existence.[6] Mega Man makes his way to Wily''s fortress and defeats Bass and Treble,  and then Dr. Wily himself. As usual,  Wily begs for mercy,  but after giving him six chances to change his ways,  Mega Man chooses to finish off the mad doctor for good,  and threatens him with his Mega Buster. Terrified,  Wily explains that as a robot,  Mega Man is prevented from harming humans; Mega Man counters that he is "more than a robot" (In the Japanese version,  Mega Man stops and stands in silence).

The game is part of the Gargoyle''s Quest sub-series of the Ghosts ''n Goblins franchise. It is said that the world was once divided into two realms,  one belonging to humans and one inhabited by demons.  One day six magical crests,  each containing power over one of the elements,  fell into the Demon Realm (Makai in the Japanese version). The realm erupted into civil war as the demons fought over the crests. Thus,  the Crest War raged until Firebrand,  the Red Demon (Red Arremer  in the Japanese Version),  claimed the crests of Earth,  Wind,  Fire,  Water and Time. Not satisfied that possessing that those Crests alone would end the war,  he fought Somulo for the prize of the Crest of Heaven,  Firebrand emerged victorious. But the cost of victory was high,  as he was mortally wounded. In that moment a cunning demon named Phalanx took advantage of Firebrand’s weakness and ambushed him,  stealing the Crests he’d fought so hard to gain and claiming their power as his own.  Phalanx used this power to summon the Crest of Infinity but,  little did he know,  the Crest of Fire had been damaged in the earlier battle,  (a shard of it was still in Firebrand’s possession) causing it to shatter.  Phalanx was unable to attain ultimate power but still managed to bring an end to the Crest War by setting the Demon Realm ablaze (whether this was intentional or by accident was never explained).  Phalanx would go on to blame the catastrophe on Firebrand,  rescue all of the victims and use his newfound popularity to crown himself their ruler. Meanwhile Firebrand was imprisoned within the Coliseum,  healing his wounds and biding his time until he could escape.  After many years he saw his opportunity and broke free.  But his path was blocked by his old foe,  Somulo,  who had used the remnants of the power he drew from the Crest of Heaven to revive himself.  Barely surviving his rematch with the undead dragon,  Firebrand emerges into a world now ruled by Phalanx.  This is the beginning of his quest to reclaim the power of the Crests and take vengeance upon Phalanx once and for all.

Super Aleste also offers a "Short Game",  featuring short segments of the regular levels,  with the emphasis on scoring as many points as possible. The story differs slightly depending on which version is played,  though the opening premise is always the same. In the year 2048,  a large mechanical sphere falls from space and starts attacking major cities around the world. After much destruction,  the sphere hovers over the jungles of South America,  drawing lines into the ground similar to the Nazca Line drawings as it expands itself and draws energy from the jungle foliage. Equipped with its own defense system,  The Sphere destroys all attacks made on it by Earth''s military. The original Aleste fighter ship''s failure to stop the sphere''s growth prompts the construction of a space fighter capable of wielding amazing weaponry,  that fighter being the Super Aleste. Tasked with flying into and destroying the sphere,  the Super Aleste must also destroy any reinforcements the sphere calls for which come from the deepest depths of space. In the original Japanese story,  the Super Aleste is piloted by an ace named Raz and his co-pilot is a mysterious young alien woman named Thi,  a prisoner aboard the sphere who harnesses strange powers freed by the constant attacks against the sphere. Thi''s role in the game is to fly with Raz into the sphere,  weaken its defenses and properly wrest the sphere''s power source.

After a touchdown is scored,  the half ends and the 2nd half of the game starts. If the player scores in both halves,  they win the game and then move on to the next level of difficulty. Difficulty levels after high school go from college,  pro,  then to super. The higher the difficulty,  the less amount of time is given for a player to score a touchdown. Since the game is concerned with scoring touchdowns,  in the 1 player game the player is always on offense. Players can score points for completing passes and for gaining yards by either rushing or passing. Scoring a touchdown also adds to the player''s score,  as does any remaining time on the clock after the touchdown is scored. Also after a touchdown,  the player can add on to their score by kicking an extra point. Other rules on the field include getting a 1st down to add time to the clock. If the player throws an interception or goes four downs without getting a 1st down,  they are penalized yards.

Al igual que ocurriría con otro de los títulos de igual género procedentes de la misma compañía,  Fatal Fury (1991),  Art of Fighting establecería una nueva saga,  seguida por millones de aficionados en todo el mundo. Incorporaba elementos que lo diferenciaban del título estrella de Capcom: A nivel de diseño presentaba un modo de juego basado en una historia más compleja y que relacionaba a todos los personajes. A nivel de metodología de juego añadía una nueva barra de energía (una especie de ki),  además de la barra de vida del personaje,  con lo que se limitaba el uso de golpes especiales,  sólo mientras el personaje tuviera dicha barra disponible (se podía recargar). A nivel técnico añadía un sistema de encuadre de la acción,  de tal forma que permitía ver de cerca a los personajes cuando tenían contacto cuerpo a cuerpo,  mediante un efecto de escalado (o zoom). Cabe destacar el enorme tamaño de los personajes,  que ocupaban toda la pantalla. Fue el primer cartucho de NeoGeo que alcanzó la simbólica cifra de 100 Mbits (tenía 102 Mb),  algo nunca visto en ningún otro juego hasta la fecha. Art of Fighting fue el primer juego de lucha de SNK en presentar los diseños de personajes del ex ilustrador Shinkiro,  quien continuaría diseñando los personajes para los juegos posteriores Fatal Fury y The King of Fighters.', 'SNK', 'Fighting', 'images/boxart/102938.png');

It was the first Adventure Island game released for the SNES and came out between the releases of the NES games Adventure Island II and Adventure Island 3. It was later followed by Super Adventure Island II. The game''s soundtrack was composed by Yuzo Koshiro. Over the course of his adventures,  Master Higgins managed to maintain the peace and tranquility of his home,  the mystical Adventure Island,  and even earned the love and support of the local "Miss Jungle",  the lovely Tina (erroneously called "Jeannie Jungle" in English materials). At nighttime,  the young hero was quietly enjoying a well-deserved rest with his grateful girlfriend Tina loyally leaning on his side atop a treetop (said to be stargazing in the English manual). When the warmth of Tina''s soft touch suddenly becomes a chilling coldness,  he turns around and is shocked to find that the evil sorcerer,  Dark Cloak,  used a spell to turn Tina into a stone statue for eternity. Dark Cloak retreats to the legendary Ice Mountain across the sea,  and Higgins resolves to defeat the wicked sorcerer in order to restore her to life. The player controls Higgins as he travels his way through five stages with four areas each. The first three areas in each stage has Higgins fighting his way through an obstacle course,  fighting many traps and enemies,  in order to reach the goal ball. The final area in each stage consists of a boss battle. Other than the improved visuals and audio as a result of the switch of hardware to the SNES,  the rules of the game are not much different from the original Adventure Island. Although released shortly after Adventure Island II for the NES,  Master Higgins'' dinosaur companions are not present in this installment. However,  Higgins now has a choice between two weapons: the standard stone axe from previous games and a boomerang (which was later introduced in Adventure Island 3). Whereas the axe can only be tossed left or right,  Higgins can shoot the boomerang in four directions (up and down,  as well as left and right). When Higgins first picks a weapon,  he can only toss one shot at a time. By picking up the same weapon in a row,  Higgins can toss up to three shots consecutively. When Higgins picks a fourth weapon of the same kind,  his shots will turn into fireballs,  which are more powerful and capable of destroying stones. At this point,  when the player switches from axes to boomerangs or vice versa,  the fireball effect will remain in place until the player loses a life. While Higgins has lost the ability to run faster in this game,  he has gained the ability to crouch,  which can be followed up with a super-jump. During gameplay,  Master Higgins must collect tropical fruit in order to keep his life bar from depleting; he also can acquire a skateboard which will allow him to travel across the stage faster.', 'Produce', 'Platform', 'images/boxart/104330.png');
